# Backend Notes App 📝

![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-7.4%2B-success)

A simple notes application built entirely with **PHP** and **SQLite**, using only server-side rendering. This project is designed to learn the fundamentals of backend development — handling form submissions, working with databases, and generating dynamic HTML pages — all without frameworks.

Perfect for a beginner like me taking their first steps into backend programming.

## 🚀 Overview

This is a minimal web application where all logic runs on the server using **pure PHP**. You can:

- View a list of notes
- Add a new note
- Edit an existing note
- Delete a note

All pages are generated by PHP on the server. There’s no JavaScript, no API, and no JSON _yet_ — just HTML forms and PHP processing everything behind the scenes.

My goal is to understand how websites work under the hood — how data is stored, retrieved, and displayed using basic tools.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **PHP** – Handles all logic and page rendering
- **SQLite** – Lightweight database stored in a file (`notes.db`)
- **HTML + Forms** – Simple templates rendered by PHP
- **Built-in PHP Server** – Run locally with `php -S localhost:8000`

## 💡 Why This Project?

This is my first backend project, and I built it to understand:

    How PHP connects to a database
    How HTML forms send data to the server
    How to safely insert and retrieve data using SQL
    How websites can store and show dynamic content

This project will lay the foundations that will help me grow into more advanced topics later, like APIs, security, and full-stack apps.
